# PricePredictor

Housing Price Prediction Model

This Python program implements a predictive model for housing prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, neighborhood, and year built. The model utilizes the scikit-learn library for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction. Key features of the program include:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle categorical variables, remove outliers, and standardize numerical features.
Model Training: A Linear Regression model is trained using a pipeline, which combines preprocessing steps and model fitting for efficient processing.
Prediction Functionality: Users can make predictions for house prices by inputting relevant features, such as square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, neighborhood, and year built.
This program serves as a practical example of applying machine learning techniques to real-world datasets.
